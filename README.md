# anonymized

In this repository, you'll find a collection of all the files from our Wikidata/Wikipedia based NER dataset.

We have provided the files for each of the NER types Drink, Food, Hobby, Job, Pet, and Sport, separately.

We also included the re-annotated dev & test sets of the CoNLL++ dataset.

Lastly, a combination of all the data is found in the file Final_bioData_ALL.

Note: all the data is in CoNLL format, and the BIO tagging scheme is used for labeling the named entities.
